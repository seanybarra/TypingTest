# Typing Test

Web page application built with html,css,javascript, and bootstrap to provide a simple one minute typing test to measure typing speed

## Description

This is just a bare bones program that allows oneself to measure how fast they can type. The timer is hard coded for one minute. The program checks whether the word you're typing is correct when compared to the highlighted word. After the one minute is up the program disables the ability for the user to keep typing and displays their typing speed (WPM), words typed correctly and incorrectly.

## How to run the program
To run the program I highly advise the user to download the project zip folder extract it to the desktop of their work station and double click the `index.html` file. The program will automatically load in their default web browser.

## FAQ

Q: I finished the test but I want to retake it how do I restart the test?
A: All one needs to do is click the refresh button in the browser, or press ctrl+r for windows users or cmd+r for MAC users.

A: At this time, no, but in the future I plan to implement that functionality.
